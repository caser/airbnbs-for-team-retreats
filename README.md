## Planning a retreat for your startup?

We discover a lot of awesome AirBnBs in our scouting for [Hacker Paradise](http://hackerparadise.org), so as a side project, we decided to release the top ones publicly in an open, community-driven list.

[You can check it out here.](http://caser.github.io/airbnbs-for-team-retreats/).

So far, we've added venues in the following destinations

  * Canary Islands, Spain
  * Lisbon, Portugal
  * Tamarindo, Costa Rica
  * Manuel Antonio, Costa Rica
  * Barcelona, Spain
  * San Diego, California
  * Berlin, Germany
  * Stockholm, Sweden
  * Tokyo, Japan
  * Broader Japan
